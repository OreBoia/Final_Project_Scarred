      I feel so dumb, I\u2019m trying this new thing. She said this could help me,
      but I\u2019m not so sure. I don\u2019t know where I found the will to write
      this letter, I think I was just bored. I don\u2019t feel like this will lead
      anywhere, but here I am, writing...   So, back on track, I have to share my
      day with you..."
